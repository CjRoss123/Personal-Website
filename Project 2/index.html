      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Christopher Ross and I am a college graduate from CUNY New York City College of Technology
        with a major in Computer Systems Technology and received a cum laude honors distinction. In my high school,
        Uncommon Collegiate Charter, I earned multiple honor roll awards and received an invitation from the National
        Honors Society.
        Aside from school work, I was an active member of multiple clubs such as the Art Club, Guitar Club, Soccer Club,
        and Dance Club.
        Outside of school I did a lot of volunteer work, such as cleaning up and building a garden in Rockaway Beach or
        reading to children with autism in an elementary school. Also, I went to both George Mason University and Long
        Island University
        as part of an art design program focused on coding video game projects using the Unity platform.
      </p>
      <p>As a Web Developer, I am a highly creative and dependable individual with a superb work ethic and a passion for
        web development.
        I have a broad and deep knowledge of a wide variety of computer languages, as well as the principles and
        techniques of website construction
        and maintenance. I am a quick learner and a team player, with excellent communication skills and a strong desire
        to grow and develop
        my skills in the field. I am seeking an opportunity to work with a dynamic team of professionals where I can
        apply my skills and knowledge
        to contribute to the success of the organization while gaining valuable experience and advancing my career.
      </p>
