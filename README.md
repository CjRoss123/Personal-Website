# Personal-Website
In this project, the layout of the webpage consists of a navigation list at the top which has the intention of directing the user to different webpages based on the topic (in progress), a text section describing who I am and what users can expect from browsing my site, 3 buttons below that will take the user to various links based on the description, and finally a Contact Me footer at the very bottom, allowing for my contact information if required (in progress). The purpose of this project is to showcase my character and skills in order to have recruiters know what to expect from me as I plan to work in entry-level web development. As for the code, in my HTML file I utilize Bootstrap to add a clean format and font to the page, along with using container fluid in order to align the content with no breakpoints regardless of the user device. In my CSS and SCSS file, I add specific colors, margin, font-sizing, etc. to make the content presentable. Lastly, in my JavaScript file I link the specific URLS to my professional profiles based on different sites to take users to when they click one of the 3 buttons presented at the bottom of the page.
